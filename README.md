# Lab 8 - Starter

 1. I would fit my automated tests in my Recipe project development pipeline within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This ensures that tests are always run on every code change without any manual effort on my part.
 2. I would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output. Rather, I would use a unit test.
