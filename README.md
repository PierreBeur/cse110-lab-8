# Lab 8 - Starter

Charles-Pierre Beurtheret

 1. I would fit my automated tests in my Recipe project development pipeline within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This ensures that tests are always run on every code change without any manual effort on my part.
 2. I would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output. Rather, I would use a unit test.
 3. I would not use a unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application, because the "message" feature involves individual components interacting with each other on an application/feature level.
 4. I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application, because the feature is a small component that does not affect other app features.
